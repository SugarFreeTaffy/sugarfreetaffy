i think i just met love today
but it wasn’t how i imagined it in my head
it wasn’t slow mo nor was it magical
but it was the start of something so special

love was flawed but it made me love her more
love did not know harry potter nor the beatles
love hated coffee shops and museums
but love surely knew how to make each moment memorable

love is unexpected
love is not any of my ideals
love is requires so much; yet,
love is everything i ever wanted
